#My homepage

Loads r/a/dio currently playing info. currently updates everything with JS and thus cannot 'change' tracks dynamically. Fixing that is one of the current goals.

It cycles backgrounds randomly on load using togglerandomBG.js from the images numbered 1 - n in the /images folder.

##Current Goals:
<ul>
    <li>A button that launches Foobar/AIMP3 with the r/a/dio stream or the r/a/dio stream in-browser after the button press</li>
    <li>Ultimately auto-updates from API (Song Changes and time updates)</li>
    <li>Possibly a mobile/smaller resolution version, as this is my personal site it doesn't really display well with small resolutions.</li>
</ul>

##Completed Goals:
<ul>
    <li>Base Site</li>
    <li>404 Page</li>
    <li>PHP cURL script to obtain info from the r/a/dio api</li>
    <li>JS to display the aforementioned information</li>
    <li>Now Playing r/a/dio</li>
    <li>DJ Box with images r/a/dio</li>
    <li>Listener Count</li>
    <li>Starting time/Ending Time (Song)</li>
    <li>Make Starting time tick 'up' with JS</li>
    <li>Progress bar based on Starting time progress</li>
</ul>
