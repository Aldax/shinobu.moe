#Current Goals:
<ul>
    <li>More interaction with API</li>
    <li>Ultimately auto-updates from API</li>
    <li>Possibly a mobile/smaller resolution version, as this is my personal site it doesn't really display well with small resolutions.</li>
</ul>

#Completed Goals:
<ul>
    <li>Base Site</li>
    <li>404 Page</li>
    <li>PHP cURL script to obtain info from the r/a/dio api</li>
    <li>JS to show some of that information (WIP)</li>
</ul>
